## Welcome!

Welcome to the R for Novices lesson series using the Gapminder dataset.

This is an adapted version of the [Software Carpentry R-novice-gapminder](https://swcarpentry.github.io/r-novice-gapminder/) course, designed to provide a clearer, more focused learning experience. These lessons are a **supplementary resource** for R programming workshops and independent learning—use them to supplement your teaching or guide your learning journey.

**Each lesson is available in two formats:**
- **Page** - Detailed content for reading and reference
- **Slides** - Presentation format for following along in workshops or for teaching

## About the Slides

The slides on this site are built with [Quarto](https://quarto.org/), an open-source publishing system that lets you write content in plain text and turn it into websites, slides, PDFs, and more — all from the same source.

The slide decks use **Quarto's reveal.js format**, and they're honestly pretty cool. You can:

- Navigate **horizontally** through main topics or **vertically** through sub-topics
- Press **F** to go full screen
- Press **S** to open **speaker/presentation mode** (with notes and a timer)
- Hit **E** to switch to a **PDF-friendly view**, then print or save as PDF
- Use the built-in **chalkboard** to draw on slides during a live session

It's an excellent setup for teaching — everything lives in one place, looks clean, and just works in the browser. No PowerPoint, no extra software.

## About

This is a decluttered adaptation of Software Carpentry's R programming course, optimized for teaching and learning. The content has been streamlined to provide clear, focused lessons while maintaining the core learning objectives.

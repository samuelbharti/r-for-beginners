## Overview

**Questions:**

- How can I write software that other people can use?

**Objectives:**

- Describe best practices for writing R and explain the justification for each

## Keep Projects Organized

Keep your project folder structured, organized, and tidy. Create subfolders for:

- code
- data
- documentation
- results and figures

RStudio projects help, and you can automate setup with packages such as [ProjectTemplate](https://projecttemplate.net/index.html).

## Tip: ProjectTemplate

```r
install.packages("ProjectTemplate")
library("ProjectTemplate")
create.project("../my_project_2", merge.strategy = "allow.non.conflict")
```

## Make Code Readable

Readable code matters more than clever code. Someone else should be able to understand your work quickly, and that someone is often you in six months.

## Document What and Why

Comments should explain **what problem** you are solving and **why** you made a decision. The **how** is usually clear from the code itself.

## Keep Code Modular

Separate your functions from analysis scripts and store them in a file you `source()` when you start a project. Small, single-purpose functions are easier to test and reuse.

## Test Your Work

Make sure your functions do the right thing. Tests build confidence and prevent regressions.

## Do Not Repeat Yourself

Repeated blocks of code are good candidates for functions. This makes your project easier to maintain and update.

## Be Consistent in Style

Use consistent naming, indentation, and formatting. Style consistency makes collaboration easier.

## Key Points

- Keep your project folder structured and tidy
- Document what and why, not just how
- Break programs into short single-purpose functions
- Write re-runnable tests
- Do not repeat yourself
- Be consistent in naming and style

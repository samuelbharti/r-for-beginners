## Overview

**Questions:**

- How can I organize my R projects?

**Objectives:**

- Create self-contained projects in RStudio
- Organize project files effectively

## Why Project Structure Matters

Poor organization mixes files, makes it hard to find things, and complicates sharing. Good structure:

- Protects data integrity
- Makes collaboration easier  
- Aids reproducibility
- Helps you find what you need

## Creating a Project

RStudio's project feature creates a self-contained, reproducible workspace:

::: {.callout-note icon=false}
## Challenge 1: Create an RStudio Project

1. Click File → New Project
2. Click "New Directory"
3. Click "New Project"
4. Name your project (e.g., "my_project")
5. Check "Create a git repository" if available
6. Click "Create Project"

A `.Rproj` file will be created. Double-click it to open the project and set R's working directory to the project folder.

## Best Practices for Project Organization

### Data is Read-Only

Raw data is valuable and time-consuming to collect. Treat it as read-only to ensure you know the original source and all modifications made.

### Data Cleaning

Store preprocessing scripts separately from raw data. Keep cleaned data in a separate output folder to avoid confusion.

### Generated Output is Disposable

Scripts should regenerate all outputs. Organize outputs by analysis type in subdirectories for easier management later.

### Separate Functions and Applications

Create separate folders for:
- Reusable functions (used across analyses)
- Analysis scripts (project-specific workflows)

### Working Directory

Check your working directory:

```{r}
#| eval: false
#| echo: true

getwd()        # check current directory
setwd("path")  # change directory
```

::: {.callout-note icon=false}
## Challenge 2: Working Directories

1. Type `getwd()` in the console
2. Use Files pane to navigate to the `data` folder
3. Change directory: `setwd("data")`
4. Check new directory: `getwd()`
5. Return: `setwd("..")`

## Key Points

- Use RStudio to create and manage projects with consistent layout
- Treat raw data as read-only
- Treat generated output as disposable
- Separate function definition and application

## Welcome!

Welcome to the R for Novices lesson series using the Gapminder dataset.

This is an adapted version of the [Software Carpentry R-novice-gapminder](https://swcarpentry.github.io/r-novice-gapminder/) course, designed to provide a clearer, more focused learning experience. These lessons are a **supplementary resource** for R programming workshops and independent learning—use them to supplement your teaching or guide your learning journey.

**Each lesson is available in two formats:**
- **Page** - Detailed content for reading and reference
- **Slides** - Presentation format for following along in workshops or for teaching
